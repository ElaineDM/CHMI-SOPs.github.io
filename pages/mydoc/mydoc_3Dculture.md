## Before starting

The protocol below adapted from [this JOVE video](https://www.jove.com/video/3367/rotating-cell-culture-systems-for-human-cell-culture-human) and published work from the laboratory of [Carolyn Coyne](http://www.mmg.pitt.edu/person/carolyn-coyne), particularly [this 2015 mSphere paper](http://msphere.asm.org/content/1/1/e00030-15)

1. Use sterile tissue culture technique throughout all steps of this protocol. 
2. **Do not use bleach on the STLV machine or parts at any point** Use of bleach may damage the center membrane of the STLV and/or leave residues that affect cell viability.
3. **Do not use general stock glassware**, even if it has been autoclaved. Use only sterile packaged plasticware.  We have had numerous situations where the general use glassware has residual detergents that affect cell viability.


## Materials and supplies

* RCCS4H 3D Cell Culture System from [Synthecon](http://synthecon.com/pages/home.asp).
* four autoclavable 55 ml slow-turning lateral vessels (STLV)
* CO2 incubator at 37oC.
* Inverted light microscope.
* 70% ethanol
* Sterilized water
* Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS)
* Heat inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (HI-FBS)
* D10 medium: DMEM + 10% HI-FBS + 0.05% antibiotic (Pen/Strep - Sigma). Sterilized D10 by filtration.
* Cytodex 3 microcarrier beads (Sigma, cat# C3275).  


## Preparing the STLVs

* **Day 1**: Get a clean STLV, tighten the central screw and fill the vessel with 70% ethanol. Be careful when closing it. Leave overnight on the bench.
* **Day 2**: Discard ethanol of the vessel and replace it with sterilized water. Leave overnight on the benchtop.
* **Day 3**: Discard the contents and replace with another aliquot of sterilized water. Leave it overnight.
* **Day 4**: Discard the water. Loosen the screw halfway through, take out the center port, remove the luer caps and autoclave the open vessel and the center port, inside an autoclave pouch (15 min, gravity cycle, 121C). Remove from the autoclave immediately after the cycle is done. Let it cool and use it immediately or store it for later use, as needed, in a clean, dry area. 
* **Day before use**: tighten the screw, fill the STLV with sterile DPBS, close the center port. Screw one-way stopcocks to the other two openings and plug one luer-lock syringe in each side (5 and 10ml). Let it rotate overnight in the STLV, 20 rpm to monitor for leaks. 

## Preparing culture beads

* Add 250 Î¼l of Cytodex bead solution to a 50 ml conical tube containing 15 ml of DPBS. 
* Autoclave it in **liquid cycle**, 30 min at 121oC.  For that, keep the cap of the tube loose, and place it in a beaker or heat resistant rack.
* Allow the the beads to cool and settle down. Remove the DPBS supernatant and discard it.
* Wash the beads with 15 ml of D10 medium.  Agitate manually, let the beads to settle down and discard D10 supernatant. Repeat the procedure 3x, the last time right before using the beads.

{% include note.html content="Sterile beads can be stored at 4C for weeks for later use. Do an extra wash with fresh D10 on the day of experiment and bring the final volume to ~15 ml" %}

## Caco-2 cell culture
* Pull cells from frozen storage.  Thaw rapidly in 37oC water bath. 
* Transfer thawed contents to a T25 flask with 8-10 ml of prewarmed D10 medium.
* Incubate at 37oC under 5% CO2 and wait for confluent growth.
* Expand cells to three T75 flasks. 
* Keep working cultures of the cells by subculturing them once or twice a week, as needed.

## Seeding the STLVs
* Remove STLV that was rotating with DPBS overnight. Remove the syringes and drain the DPBS. Replace with new syringes (without the plungers; keep them sterile for later use).
* Trypsinize one T75 flask and ressuspend in 10 ml of D10. 
* Add the cells to the bead suspension to give ca. 20 ml of volume. 
* Transfer the cells-bead suspension carefully to the STLV vessel through the center port. 
* Recover residual cells-bead mix from tube with D10 media and transfer to the STLV. Be very careful to not contaminate the culture.
* Close the center port and q.s. volume in STLV vessel to 50 ml with D10 media (until liquid starts overflow back into the syringe). 
* Take out as many as bubbles as you can by carefully tilting the STLV and using the syringes. You can do it first without the plunges and then, take minor bubbles with the aid of plunges. *Be careful to control pressure to not expel the center port*. 
* Incubate the STLV for 30 minutes at 37oC, 5% CO2 without movement to allow the cells to attach to the beads. 
* Examine the STLV and remove any remaining air bubbles
* Set STLV to rotate at 20 rpm at 37oC, 5% CO2 for 21-28 days, as needed.

## Feeding the STLV
* Exchange the culture medium every other day. For the weekend, with Caco-2 cells, it is OK to exchange D10 on Friday late afternoon and on Monday early in the morning. 
* Remove STLV from incubator, remove syringes, let the beads to settle.
* Hold the STLV inclined, tapping the center port for the beads to stay in the bottom side of the reactor. Carefully remove ~80% of the spent culture medium through the stopcocks. 
* Replace the syringes and fill the vessel with fresh D10.  Return the STLV immediately for rotation. 

## Harvesting cells
* to monitor cell growth during the culture period, a small volume of bead suspension (ca. 100 microliters) may be removed through the center port, by carefully withdrawing the culture with a **cut** pippete tip.

{% include important.html content="use a 1 ml cut pippete tip to prevent shear and protect the 3D structures." %}

* After 3-4 weeks of continuous culture, drain D10 culture medium (ca. 80%) as it would be done for feeding. Then, transfer the 3D culture beads to a 50 mL conical tube. 
* Adjust the volume to 15 ml and use as needed for microscopic or RNA Seq experiments. When getting aliquots for experiments, keep in mind the tube has to be agitated often to keep the cells in suspension in order to get homogeneous number of cells.

## STLV clean-up

* **Day 1**: fill empty vessel with 70% ethanol through the center port. Close all the openings. Be careful when closing it. It may spill. Wear goggle. Leave it overnight on bench.
* **Day 2**: Drain the contents through the center port and refill the vessel with a new aliquot of 70% ethanol. Leave it overnight.

* **Day 3**:* Unscrew and take apart all the components. Wash by hand carefully. To wash parts with beads adhered, it is OK to use a toothbrush. 

{% include warning.html content="the central membrane is very delicate and is easily damaged- it should **only** be washed with gentle rubbing...no brushes of any kind" %}

* Let STLV dry on an absorbent paper in clean area (bench is fine). 

* to reuse, repeat the 'preparing the STLV' above
